\title{Download of reference evapotranspiration (eto) and rainfall (ppt) from 'TerraClimate'}
\usage{
download_terraclimate(variable, years, region, sub_region)
}
\arguments{
\item{variable}{variable to download. This function will download the eto or ppt (Rasterstack).}

\item{years}{The period in years that the function should download images.}

\item{region}{Use the "brazil" shapefile to extract the Rasterstack (variable) for one state (Brazilian state), or use the "biomes_brazil" to extract the Rasterstack (variable) for one biome of Brazil.}

\item{sub_region}{You have two options in this section, if you choice the brazil (in region parameter) you need to choice the Brazilian states, but if you choice the biomes_brazil (in region parameter) you must choice one of Brazilian biomes.}
}
\value{
Load the ppt (Rainfall) or eto (reference evapotranspiration) rasterstack
}
\description{
This function will download the eto and ppt and will load a rasterstack according to the the region of interest (Region and sub_region).
